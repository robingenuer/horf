Description: This package contains necessary functions to reproduce the simulation experiments of the article Arlot and Genuer (2026). In this article the rate of convergence of Hold-Out Random Forests are studied. Thus, the package gives an implementation of this Random Forests variant and a plot function to visualize the convergence rate.
